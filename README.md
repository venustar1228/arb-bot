# Arbitrage Bot
 Trading bot that utilizes Solidity contracts, in conjunction with decentralized exchanges, to execute token arbitrage opportunities on any EVM compatible blockchain. 
 
 TODOs:
 - Finish initial configuration, port over web3.js references to ethers.js, setup hardhat, etc. See existing readme in downloads
 - Research new stategies, create modular scripts for each blockchain, implement bot for DEXs on AVAX/FTM/MATIC, etc. 
 - Neat React front-end
 - Find inspiration for data pipelines
 - Write up TDD here and setup instructions, maybe draw out FSM
 - Is it worth doing this proj in Rust?  
 - Ideally make this super portable for new DEXs
